Opioid addiction and mortality skyrocketed over the past decade. A casual look at the geographic
incidence of opioid mortality shows sharply higher mortality rates in the Appalachian region,
especially in coal-mining areas. This has led observers to make a link that was characterized by
one newspaper as “abandoned by coal, swallowed by opioids.” We test that theory using
restricted death data and mine level coal production data. Specifically, we examine whether
higher reliance on coal mining in a county’s economy leads to higher or lower opioid mortality.
We find a positive relationship between the share of coal miners among total local labor force and
county-level opioid mortality rates. This contradicts the “abandoned by coal, swallowed by
opioids” story. Rather our results suggest that the higher rates of injury in underground coal
mining (in particular) lead to greater amounts of opioid consumption and mortality. An
implication is that the decline in coal mining in the United States may have a positive spillover in
the form of reduced mortality from opioid use.
