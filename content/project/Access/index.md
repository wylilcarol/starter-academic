This paper exploits a unique feature of China’s history, the “sentdown
youth” (SDY) program, to study the effects of access to internal
migration. We show that temporary migration due to the SDY program
created lasting inter-province links. We interact these links with two
time-varying pull measures in potential destinations. Decades after
the SDY program ended, increased access to migration in cities that
sent SDY leads to higher rates of migration from provinces where
those SDY temporarily resided. We find that improved access to migration
leads to lower consumption volatility and lower asset holding.
Furthermore, household production shifts into high-risk, high-return
activities.
